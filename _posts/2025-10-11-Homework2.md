# Dataset & Distribution

## Dataset

A dataset is a collection of data, typically organized in **rows and columns**:

- Each **row** = one observation or **record** (one student, one car..)
- Each **columns** = one feature or **variable** (age, gender..)
- A table of students with their gender, age, and test score is a dataset.

### Key components of a Dataset

1. **Variables**
   The characteristics being measured:
   - *Quantitative*: Measurable values like height, score, or weight
   - *Qualitative*: Descriptive values like color or duty
2. **Records**
   Each data point (one full row of values)
3. **Data types**
   Each variable can have:
   - integer / float values
   - Text / string
   - Date / boolean
4. **Metadata**:
   Data about the data, for example columns names, data types, units of measurement..

## Distribution

A **distribution** show how values of a variable are spread across the possible outcomes.

- **Univariate distribution:** how one variable’s values are distributed.  
    Example: distribution of exam scores → how many students got 10–15, 15–20, etc.
- **Bivariate distribution:** how two variables vary together.  
    Example: relation between *gender* and *exam score* categories.

## Univariate and Bivariate Distribution on a dataset

Here is and example using a dataset created with sql lite

### Creating a new Table

First of all, we have to create a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cyber_attacks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  attack_type TEXT,
  severity_level TEXT,
  response_time INTEGER,
  date_detected TEXT,
  source_region TEXT,
  target_system TEXT,
  protocol TEXT,
  bytes_transferred INTEGER
);
```


### Populating our table

Now we have to insert some values into our newly created table:

```sql
INSERT INTO cyber_attacks (attack_type, severity_level, response_time, date_detected, source_region, target_system, protocol, bytes_transferred) VALUES

('DDoS','Medium',95,'2025-10-05','US','Gateway','UDP',900000),
('DDoS','High',125,'2025-10-04','EU','Web Server','UDP',1600000),
('DDoS','Medium',100,'2025-10-03','ASIA','Gateway','UDP',800000),
('Malware','Medium',76,'2025-09-28','EU','Web Server','HTTP',54000),
('Malware','Low',50,'2025-09-24','SA','Mail Server','SMTP',18000),
('Phishing','Medium',52,'2025-09-23','EU','Mail Server','SMTP',2300),
('Phishing','High',80,'2025-09-21','ASIA','Auth Server','HTTP',4800);
--... additional values omitted for brevity
```

### Univariate distribution of our dataset

A univariate distribution describes the probability distribution of a single random variable at the time.

#### Frequency of attacks

```sql
SELECT attack_type, count(*) AS frequency  
from cyber_attacks  
GROUP BY attack_type  
order by frequency desc;
```

##### Output

![FrequecyOfAttacks](/images/hw2/1frequency_of_attacks_output.png)
_Frequency of attacks_

#### Frequency of attacker by region

```sql
SELECT source_region, COUNT(*) AS frequency  
FROM cyber_attacks  
GROUP BY source_region  
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

##### Output

![img-description](/images/hw2/2attacker_by_region.png)
_Attacker by Region_

### Bivariate distribution

A bivariate distribution describes the probability of two random variables occurring at the same time, showing the relationship between them. It provides probabilities for each possible combination of values for the two variables and can be represented in a table, graph, or function.

#### Average of bites transferred by attack_type

```sql
SELECT attack_type, ROUND(avg(bytes_transferred),2) AS average_bytes  
FROM cyber_attacks  
GROUP BY attack_type  
ORDER BY average_bytes DESC;
```

##### Output

This shows which attacks tend to transfer more data, for instance, DDos attacks typically transfer much larger volume

_Bites X attacks_
![](/images/hw2/4bites_x_attack_output.png)
_Bites X attacks Graph_

#### Attack type x severity

```sql
SELECT attack_type,  
    SUM(CASE WHEN severity_level='Low' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Low,  
       SUM(CASE WHEN severity_level='Medium' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Medium,  
       SUM(CASE WHEN severity_level='High' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS High  
FROM cyber_attacks  
GROUP BY attack_type  
ORDER BY attack_type;
```
