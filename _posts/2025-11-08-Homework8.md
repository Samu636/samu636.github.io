## **Differences between the two homeworks**

Although both tasks rely on the same underlying Bernoulli structure, there are key conceptual differences:

### **1. Aggregated Bernoulli vs simple Bernoulli**

In the previous homework, each trial is directly a Bernoulli ( $p$ ) success/failure.

In this homework, each weekly outcome is a Bernoulli ( $q$ ) whose probability comes from _m combined independent attackers_:

$q = P(\text{safe}) = (1 - p)^m$

So the process is **Bernoulli, but with a probability derived from multiple independent events**.

### **2. Random walk interpretation**

The new homework introduces a **random walk**:

- Each week contributes **+1** if safe and **–1** if breached.

- The cumulative score after n weeks is

$S = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$

This is equivalent to transforming the binomial variable K via:

$S = 2K - n$

something not present in the previous assignment.

### **3. Focus on distributions, not only averages**

The previous homework focused mainly on:

- empirical means

- convergence to the true probability ppp

In this homework, you examine:

- the **full distribution** of possible final scores,

- convergence of the empirical histogram to the **binomial distribution**,

- sample random-walk trajectories.

### **4. Two kinds of limits**

In the first assignment:

- LLN is about the limit as $n \to \infty$

In this assignment:

- you also observe how the empirical distribution converges as the **number of simulated trajectories increases**,

- NOT just the number of weeks.

So you have **two different notions of convergence**.

## **Mathematical relationships**

### **1. Binomial representation**

Let

- $p$ = probability an attacker breaches

- $q = (1 - p)^m$ weekly probability of no breach

Then the number of safe weeks is:

$K = \sum_{i=1}^n I_i, \quad I_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(q)$

Thus:

$K \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n, q)$

and the cumulative score:

$S = 2K - n$

is a **shifted and rescaled binomial** random variable.

### **2. Expected value and variance**

$\mathbb{E}[S] = n(2q - 1)$
$\mathrm{Var}(S) = 4n q(1-q)$

So the random walk is biased upward if $q > 1/2$ , downward if $q < 1/2$

### **3. Law of Large Numbers**

The empirical proportion of “safe” weeks converges to $q$:

$frac{K}{n} \xrightarrow[]{\text{a.s.}}$
which parallels the previous homework where

$\frac{\text{successes}}{n} \to p$

### **4. Central Limit Theorem**

For large nnn:

$\frac{K - nq}{\sqrt{n q(1-q)}} \approx \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
and therefore the final score $S$ approaches a normal distribution as well.
